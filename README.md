# WulkanizacjaApp:

This app is a project which I made with my friend for university. 
It is an online listing app for car tires. When you want new tires you just open your app and search for the best one for yourself. Just like when you open amazon to buy new things but this one is focused on just one type of product. This is an android application. The app was made using Java and XML.

## Example:

I made a quick video to showcase a typical use case scenario.

## Note:
App is made in polish because it is made for my University and I study in polish language :)
